### Shiny Events

Long, long ago.. (actual: weeks ago) there was no surefire way for users to customize how information passed to the Google Calendar Events. Information added in at the time of booking the appointment simply carried over to the Events. The titles displayed the customer’s name, the business, and the Appointment Type’s title.

Sometimes you just don’t want to display every bit of information in the Events. You would really love it to look more simplified, or extra fancy! With that said, our developers created a way for users to customize the Event title and description. Now you can customize the content of the events to your heart’s, well, content!

If you’re excited to try this shiny feature out, all it involves is enabling this feature called “Google Calendar Events Customization (Beta)” within yourDeveloper Settings. If you need some pointers on how to enable this, visit thisnifty guide.

### The Possibilities Are Endless

Let’s take it from the top. Within yourGoogle Settingsin SSA, you can now edit your Event title so that it contains exactly what you hoped for. So if that plus sign was bothering you a bit, you can finally show it the door.

There is also an “Event Location” field now that you can fill out with where the appointment is taking place at! Now customers will be able to tell where to go.

But, of course, we understand if you don’t want the entirety of the form’s entry and information showing up on the event. Maybe you just want to keep it minimal for the customer’s sake and only show specific information. Withbasicoradvanced twigs, you can call upon certain information to appear.

Here’s a little nifty example of this in action:

For the curious, you can achieve the above like so:
