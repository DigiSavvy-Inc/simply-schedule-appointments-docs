This guide will show you how to create a custom page to host the SSA rescheduling, cancellation, and field editing screen – also known as the Edit Appointments module. This is an excellent option if you’d prefer to have more control of how the Edit Appointments page looks instead of using our blank default page.

You can only specify a single custom pageto edit appointments.

### Create an Edit Appointments Page

Embed the following shortcode on your new Edit Appointments page; this can be added to a new page or added to an existing page on your website:

```
[ssa_confirmation]
```

`[ssa_confirmation]`

By default, this shortcode says, “Simply Schedule Appointments Booking Confirmation.” You’re welcome tochange the texthere, but remember that this converts into theEdit Appointments modulewhen accessed through anEdit Appointments link.

### Update the Edit Appointment Page Field

Now that you have a page set up to host the Edit Appointments module, we have one last step to ensure that Simply Schedule Appointments redirects to this page when someone uses alink to Edit Appointments.

Go to theSSA Settingstab >General Settings> use theEdit Appointment Pagedropdown to select your new Edit Appointments page.
