Inside your theme or child theme, create anssafolder. Then you can drop files into that folder to customize either the booking app (the front end place where folks go to book appointments) or the admin app (the spot in the WordPress admin where you can manage appointments, appointment types, and settings). We’ve got all the detailsin our developer documentation.
