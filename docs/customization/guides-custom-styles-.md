- Easily change colors, font, and padding from the Styles settings
- Tweak the buttons, time slot formatting, and icons using CSS directly in the Styles settings
- Or, control every detail by creating your own CSS file in your theme or adding it via our mini-plugin

### Style Settings

Easily change colors, font, and padding directly from the plugin Style Settings.

#### Accent color

This accent color appears on links, buttons, and form fields in your Booking Calendar. The default accent color is set to spring green.

#### Background color

This setting changes the background of the entire Booking Calendar. The default background color is transparent so that it can blend in with your theme.

#### Contrast Ratio

The Style settings will also display the contrast ratio for the color combination you selected for your accent and background colors. This will help you meet the accessibility guidelines and ensure readability for most users.

#### Font family

You can choose between Google Fonts or System Fonts. The default font family is Google’s Roboto typeface.

#### Padding

This is the space around the Booking Calendar. You can use any valid CSS measurement: %, em, px, vw, rem, etc. The default padding is set to 1rem.

If you’re using a Page Builder like Elementor, Divi, or Beaver Builder, this padding setting may not work because it’s overridden in the page builder.

#### Contrast mode

This changes the default font color from black to white. Use this if you have a dark background.

This will only appear if you change thebackground color opacityslider tocompletelytransparent.

### CSS Snippets in the Style Settings

Tweak buttons, headers, and time slot formatting using a bit of custom CSS within the Style Settings. You’ll find the area for entering custom CSS tucked away at the bottom of the Style Settings.

Since Simply Schedule Appointments displays via an iframe, you must add your CSS directly to our plugin to see changes. Adding it to a CSS plugin or the theme will not affect SSA.
